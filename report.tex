\section{Background Material}
The adoption and integration of new technology pose a managerial challenge with a substantial impact on overall corporate success. This section delves into the fundamentals, examining the nature of the project change, identifying various factors affected, essential mechanisms for the integration process, and outlining specific conditions that guide their effective utilization. This expertise is particularly valuable for managers overseeing technology integration, offering practical advice on navigating the process within their specific organizational contexts.


\subsection{Nature of the project change and their Impact}
Understanding a project before embracing change involves considering various factors. The primary factor is the organization's level of prior experience with technology integration, commonly referred to as technological maturity. The second factor revolves around assessing the extent to which the new technology contributes to product advancement. This evaluation involves determining whether the technology enhances the existing product's functionality beyond its original scope, thereby generating a strategic advantage. Alternatively, it considers scenarios where the new technology serves as an additional support function without altering the fundamental features of the core mechanical product \cite{reference1}.


\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figure1.png}
    \caption{Conceptual model of the project change with implications and impact \cite{reference1}.}
    \label{fig:conceptual-model}
\end{figure}

\noindent The model in Figure 1 illustrates various things involved in during the project change and their impacts. Initially understanding the existing technology and the new to-be-adopted technology results in changes to the structures, processes, resources, and culture of the organization. Further into the picture are obstacles (differentiating forces) and sources of support (integrating forces) that influence the process. Finally, understanding the technological maturity of the current product/process and the advancement done to it, streamlining the analysis of their impacts, and taking deliberate steps based on this understanding as a project manager leads to favorable outcomes, benefiting the organization.

\subsection{Role of team experience in technology/process adoption}

The seamless adoption of technology within any project is intricately linked to the collaborative efforts of the involved team. The team's collective motivation, combined with their prior knowledge and skill sets, significantly shapes the trajectory of adoption, creating an environment conducive to successful integration. However, without proper attention, challenges such as resistance to change, gaps in knowledge, a resistant mindset, and a lack of collaboration can impede the technology/process adoption process. As rightly stated, "People's commitment to change increases the chance of successful transformation and decreases the cost of change. It is the most powerful catalyst for changing approach" \cite{reference2}.


\section{Methods \& Methodology}
This section explores methods and methodologies designed to address the challenges associated with technology adoption. The focus is on strategic steps that project managers can employ to ensure the successful adoption of technology. This encompasses effective approaches to mitigate resistance, enhance knowledge transfer, deal with differentiating and integrating forces, foster a positive mindset among the team, and promote collaborative practices, as explained in the above section. Additionally, there will be a delve into the critical aspect of analyzing costs and benefits related to change adoption, securing buy-in, and implementing planning methods. The discussion will be enriched with examples from case studies illustrating how organizations have successfully handled technology adoption using these methods.


\subsection{Analyzing costs and benefits}
In the realm of technology adoption, a thorough evaluation of costs serves as a fundamental pillar in strategic decision-making. These costs, whether direct or indirect, play a pivotal role in shaping a project's trajectory. Aligning benefits with project costs is a decisive factor in determining the viability of technology adoption. Benefits, broadly categorized as tangible and intangible, bring inherent value. Tangible benefits, quantifiable by nature, encompass elements like cost reductions, heightened reliability, and increased productivity. In contrast, intangible benefits, though equally valuable, present a challenge in quantification and often materialize as enhanced business opportunities \cite{reference3}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figure2.png}
    \caption{Layers of the proposed Cost Benefit Framework \cite{reference3}.}
    \label{fig:conceptual-model}
\end{figure}

\noindent The above explained framework in Figure 2 from \cite{reference3} serves as an example of how organizations approach technology adoption by systematically analyzing costs and benefits:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Layer 1:} Direct cost estimation, covering project, facility, setup, real estate(if applicable), power, and related factors.
    \item \textbf{Layer 2:} Project-specific costs within the organization.
    \item \textbf{Layer 3:} Examination of costs linked to choosing a cloud deployment model (public or community).
    \item \textbf{Layer 4:} Focus on intangible benefits like enhanced security, data recovery, and market competitiveness.
    \item \textbf{Layer 5:} Analysis of costs tied to the specific implementation of data retrieval and storage in the cloud.
\end{itemize}

\noindent In conclusion, the illustrated framework serves as a versatile model applicable to various technology adoption processes, offering organizations a comprehensive approach for evaluating costs(direct or indirect) and benefits(tangible and intangible advantages).

\subsection{Estimation Process}
The estimation process aims to establish a systematic approach for assessing resources, efforts, and potential costs linked to adopting new technologies or processes. Employing either bottom-up or top-down approaches based on the software's decomposition structure, the bottom-up method initiates estimates at the lowest level components, aggregating them into higher-level assessments. Conversely, the top-down approach starts with an overview of the entire system, calculating estimates for component parts as relative proportions of the full estimate \cite{reference4}. Both approaches involve a detailed analysis of factors contributing to overall project estimation, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Resource Assessment:} Identifying the human resources, skill sets, and expertise required for the successful implementation of the technology.
    \item \textbf{Cost Estimation:} Determining the financial aspects, including direct costs like equipment, software licenses, and indirect costs associated with training and potential downtime.
    \item \textbf{Effort Estimation:} Assessing the amount of effort, in terms of time and labor, required for the adoption process.
    \item \textbf{Timeline and Milestones:} Establishing a timeline for the adoption process, including key milestones and checkpoints for tracking progress.
    \item \textbf{Contingency Planning:} Anticipating potential risks and uncertainties and incorporating contingency plans to mitigate unforeseen challenges.
\end{itemize}

\noindent The estimation process provides project managers with a comprehensive understanding of the resources and costs involved, facilitating better decision-making and planning throughout the technology adoption journey.


\subsection{Verification of Estimates}
Verification of estimates is a pivotal phase in ensuring the reliability of projected costs and benefits within a project. During this critical step, the project manager meticulously examines the provided estimates, aiming to identify any potential changes with a discerning eye. This involves a thorough scrutiny of the underlying data sources, methodologies, and assumptions that form the basis of the estimates.\newline

\noindent The overarching goal is to cultivate a culture of transparency and accuracy, addressing any latent biases or inaccuracies that might be present in the assessments. It is crucial to recognize that the initial and most crucial aspect of verification is related to cost, as it significantly influences the ultimate adoption decision. Empirical validation becomes paramount, as showcased in \cite{reference5}, where four algorithmic models (SLIM, COCOMO, Function Points, and ESTIMACS) proposed as general software-development cost estimators are rigorously validated.\newline

\noindent Beyond cost verification, other facets of the estimation process also demand attention and are covered by some of the algorithm models above including validating the timeline and milestones, ensuring that they align with realistic expectations. Effort verification, a key component, necessitates a comprehensive consideration of the team's skills and previous experiences to provide a realistic evaluation. Additionally, the verification process extends to scrutinizing potential risks and uncertainties, avoiding decisions based on subjective or personal grounds. In essence, the verification of estimates serves as a safeguard, significantly enhancing the credibility of the analysis. This, in turn, facilitates more robust decision-making for project leaders, contributing to the overall success of the technology adoption endeavor.

\subsection{Planning for change and Change Management}
Building on the insights gained from the previous sections and the estimates of the current state of resources, the focus now shifts to the pivotal role of planning for change in technology adoption. This strategic planning involves crucial elements such as resource allocation, the implementation of effective training programs, and the development of robust risk mitigation strategies. \newline


\noindent Change management involves the strategies implemented by management to leverage new methods, models, and technologies in order to gain a competitive advantage for organizations \cite{reference6}. The strategic dimension of change management emphasizes the importance of focusing on people and organizational transformation. \cite{reference7} explains three primary modelsâ€”Kotterâ€™s change model, Lewinâ€™s change model, and ADKARâ€™s change management modelâ€”are integral to understanding and implementing each phase in change management. Kotter's model revolves around eight key change steps, with a primary emphasis on securing top management buy-in. Lewin's model delineates three significant phasesâ€”Unfreeze, Change, Refreezeâ€”prioritizing end-user involvement and the change team. Similarly, ADKAR's model, rooted in the concepts of Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, and Reinforcement, aligns with Lewin's model's focus \cite{reference7}. \newline

\noindent In conclusion, effective technology adoption hinges on the symbiosis of planning for change and change management. Strategic planning guides resource allocation, training, and risk mitigation, while change management orchestrates organizational transformation. Models like Kotter's, Lewin's, and ADKAR's provide a structured approach. Together, these pillars ensure organizations navigate technological shifts.

\subsection{Securing Buy-In}
This section underlines the need to secure buy-in from management as well as project teams. Presenting a compelling business case underpinned by facts, figures, and concrete benefits is part of a strategic strategy. Aligning the proposed change with results that management and sponsors personally value increases the likelihood of enthusiastic approval. \newline

\noindent Despite the abundance of models and frameworks for IT adoption, challenges persist in organizations. The inadequacy of existing models to address diverse stakeholder perceptions and expectations hinders IT adoption success. Most frameworks are deterministic, neglecting the importance of various stakeholder worldviews in the adoption process. Shifting towards social-technical adoption models is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of IT adoption beyond a linear technological approach. Stakeholders, individuals or groups with organizational interests, engage in a reciprocal interaction influencing both the organization and themselves \cite{reference8}. \newline

\noindent Regular communication, addressing concerns, and showcasing progress are essential methods for sustaining buy-in throughout the adoption process. Furthermore, involving stakeholders in decision-making and seeking their input fosters a sense of ownership, increasing the likelihood of continued support. The commitment to an ongoing dialogue and adaptation to stakeholder feedback significantly contributes to the success of technology adoption initiatives.



\subsection{Overcoming Resistance}
Resistance to change is a natural hurdle in the integration of new technologies or procedures within a project. Effectively addressing and overcoming this resistance is crucial for the successful adoption of innovations. In the preceding sections, various methods have been discussed, covering aspects such as cost-benefit analysis, comprehensive estimation, verification, change management, and securing stakeholder buy-in. This section delves into strategies for overcoming resistance from both the organizational side, involving employees and developers, and all key contributors to the adoption process.\newline

\noindent According to \cite{reference9}, a three-pronged strategy known as the "3 E" approach can be instrumental in overcoming resistance to change. The first "E" emphasizes the creation of evidence. It involves making the change evident and ensuring that every individual comprehends the significance of the adoption. Providing a clear and compelling vision of how the change is evident and beneficial fosters motivation among the stakeholders. The second "E" underscores the importance of making the change easy to use. As a project manager, simplifying processes and ensuring that everyone can easily adopt the new technology or procedures streamlines the overall adoption process. \newline

\noindent Lastly, the third "E" centers on making the change essential. This involves understanding the needs and perspectives of everyone involved, clarifying the individual benefits, and demonstrating how the change is indispensable for each stakeholder. Employing this 3 E strategy can significantly contribute to a smoother adoption process and effectively overcome resistance.resistance.

\section{Results Obtained}
\subsection{Under What Conditions}
The research findings underscore the critical determinants of successful technology or process adoption, highlighting the significance of project nature, team experience, and the alignment of proposed changes with organizational objectives. Notably, successful cases are characterized by meticulous cost-benefit analyses, realistic estimation processes, and a strategic approach to change management. \newline

\noindent To elaborate, the successful integration of new technologies within organizations necessitates the acquisition of new skills or the upgrading of existing workforce skills. This is imperative because the attributes of new technologies often significantly differ from those of older technologies. In addressing this challenge, training emerges as a key strategy for two primary reasons. Firstly, training has the capacity to alter users' attitudes toward the adoption of new technologies, fostering increased acceptanceâ€”a pivotal factor for the effective utilization of new technologies \cite{reference10}.



\subsection{Constraints}
While successful technology adoption can yield significant benefits, the analysis also identifies constraints. Resistance from team members, lack of support from management, and inadequate communication strategies are common challenges. Additionally, uncertainties in estimating costs and benefits can pose constraints on effective decision-making.

\section{Conclusions and Future Works}
